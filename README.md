## NHL Play-by-Play Using the NHL API
Using the NHL API, I created my own comprehensive play-by-play data similar to what you would find from other scrapers available publicly. Many thanks to [evolving-hockey](https://evolving-hockey.com/) and Harry Shomer. I had downloaded their pbp data in the past and it served as a template of what the data should encapsulate. I was able to then adjust and add/remove any variables I wanted to capture within my data. Additional thanks to [hockey-statistics](https://hockey-statistics.com/) and [Zach Malski](https://github.com/Zmalski/NHL-API-Reference) who provided ample help in the utilization of the NHL API. I had never worked with an API before and their provided material was instrumental in the learning process.

## Future Changes
In the future, I want to convert this into a simpler scraper, but for now this will run fine. I will also be creating an Expected Goals model and may have changes as I work through that process and need to include more information in the play-by-play.
